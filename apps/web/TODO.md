# Application Idea

The application that we want to build has the following:
- The application allows you to show your portafolio of pictures
- If you are a free user you can add 5 pictures to your profile and you can have only one profile. Your profile shows a link to `Get a Portafolio`.
- If you are a pro user you can have as many profiles as you like and add as many pictures as you like to the profile.
- Both types of user can edit their full name and their avatar

We are also missing the following features:
- Add tests for all things we are adding.
- Add an authorization service (???)
- Add an admin interface using refine.dev
- Validate and Deploy app using Github actions
- Add background workers
